This submission is for etude # 4 of Hilbert Curve. To compile the file please use Python hilbert.py and the order you want to test it on.
I have tested  my code and am hopefull that it will pass all the test case
I would like to reference here a bit of help here from stock overflow.
Reference Used: #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53243985/hilbert-curve-using-turtle-graphics-and-recursion
To compile: for example
python3 email.py 7
python3 email.py 5
python3 email.py 6

I found the program quite helpful, learnt about turtle and screen libraries for changing the direction and resizing and rescaling the screen.

Thankyou Hamza and Stiffanie.
kind regards
